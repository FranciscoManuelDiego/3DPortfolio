## Project Overview.
This project is a modern 3D portfolio landing page built with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **@react-three/fiber** 

- **3D Canvas Elements:** Uses `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for interactive 3D models (e.g.Earth model, stars on the background).
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for adaptive layouts.
- **Animated UI:** Framer Motion is used for smooth section transitions and fade-in effects.
- **Contact Form:** Includes validation and integrates with EmailJS for sending messages.
- **Profile Card:** Displays user info with an avatar and contact button created with ReactBits.
- **Project Cards:** Showcases projects with links to GitHub and live demos.
- **Asset Management:** Images and 3D models are loaded from the `public` or `src/assets` folders.

Credits to Adrian | https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery for the tutorial and inspiration to create this landing page.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
